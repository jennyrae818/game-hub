## Description

Game Hub is an application created for users who are interested in games and allows them to expand that interest or hobby. This application has users login or register to enhance their gaming experience by adding games to their profile, leaving reviews, and adding likes or dislikes for their pleasure. A user can see what games other users are playing as well.

## What we learned

- Utilize Apollo Server and GraphQL through React
- Use JWT authorization
- Set state and use hooks in React
- Deploy MongoDB to Heroku
- Use Github projects to complete issues
- Work with a team of developers

## Installation

This program can be run through a browser using the link to the deployed application. Alternatively, to run this application locally you will need to:

- Navigate to https://github.com/jennyrae818/game-hub
- Clone the Github repository to recieve all of the files
- Run `npm run install` in the command line of your terminal to set up all of the dependencies.
- Populate the existing database items by running `npm run seed` in your terminal
- Run `npm run develop` to start the application and begin using it.

## Usage
